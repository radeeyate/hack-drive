# Hack Drive

Hack Drive is a proposed YSWS for Hack Club members where you create a custom filesystem using FUSE (Filesystem in Userspace) or a similar technology (WinFSP, fuse-t, MacFUSE). One thing - Your filesystem shouldn't use traditional storage methods!

The goal is to build a functional, mountable filesystem that implements a set of core operations, but uses a *non-conventional* data storage or retrieval mechanism.

Inspired by the "harder drives" concept by Tom Murphy VII (<http://tom7.org/harder/>).

## You Ship

You'll be creating a program that implements a filesystem.  This means users should be able to:

1. **Mount** your filesystem to a directory on their computer
2. **Interact** with it like a normal filesystem (create files, read files, list directories, etc.)
3. **Store (or retrieve)** data in a unconventional way

## We Ship

* **Everyone who meets the requirements:** A custom Hack Club branded flash drive!
* **Top Submission (chosen by a judging panel):** A 1TB Kingston XS2000 External SSD!

## Requirements

* Spend at least 3-4 hours working on your project.  Log your time using Hackatime (<https://waka.hackclub.com/>).
* Your project *must* be open source (e.g., on GitHub).
* The project must implement a *mountable and functional* filesystem.
* Your filesystem *must* support at least the following operations:
  * `getattr` (get file attributes)
  * `create` (create a new file)
  * `open` (open a file)
  * `read` (read from a file)
  * `write` (write to a file)
  * `readdir` (list files in a directory)
* The data storage method *cannot* be conventional. You cannot:
  * Store data on a local disk or in a RAM disk
* Acceptable and encouraged ideas:
  * Storing files on YouTube (by encoding them into video frames)
  * A Slack client interacted with via the filesystem
  * Storing files on a blockchain
  * Encoding files into QR codes
  * A Fediverse client
  * *Any other weird thing you can think of*
* Your filesystem doesn't *have* to store files in the traditional sense. For example, you could create a filesystem that acts as a Slack client, where creating a file sends a message, and reading a file displays messages.  The key is to present a filesystem *interface* to the user, even if the underlying data isn't typical "files."

## Tools and Libraries

You can use any of the following (or a similar tool):

* **FUSE (Linux):**  A widely used framework for creating filesystems in userspace
  * C:  [libfuse](https://github.com/libfuse/libfuse)
  * Go:  [go-fuse](https://github.com/hanwen/go-fuse)
  * Python:  [pyfuse3](https://github.com/libfuse/pyfuse3)
  * Rust:  [fuser](https://github.com/cberner/fuser)
  * Java: [jnr-fuse](https://github.com/SerCeMan/jnr-fuse)
  * [awesome-fuse-fs](https://github.com/koding/awesome-fuse-fs) - A list of FUSE filesystems and tools
* **WinFSP (Windows):**  The Windows equivalent of FUSE
  * [WinFSP](https://github.com/billziss-gh/winfsp)
  * Go (also works with FUSE and MacFUSE):  [cgofuse](https://github.com/winfsp/cgofuse)
  * Rust: [winfsp-rs](https://github.com/SnowflakePowered/winfsp-rs)
  * Java: [jnr-winfsp](https://github.com/jnr-winfsp-team/jnr-winfsp)
  * Python: [winfspy](https://github.com/Scille/winfspy)
* **fuse-t (macOS):**  A newer FUSE implementation for macOS.  (Should be compatible with many existing FUSE libraries)
  * [fuse-t](https://github.com/macos-fuse-t/fuse-t)
* **MacFUSE (macOS):**  The older FUSE implementation for macOS
